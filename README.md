Introduction to Arduino coding in C 

Hello, welcome in! This repository aims to document my progress and aventures in the world of embedded systems. As it just so happens, I have decided to learn the inner workings of the arduino UNO!

Prerequisite knowledge:
> An fundamental understanding of how base 2 works
> An fundamental understanding of base 16
> A decent grasp of the c programming langage, although I suppose one could follow along with minimal exposure
> Knowledge of bitwise operations and logic gates
