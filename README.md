Introduction to Arduino coding in C 

Hello, welcome in! This repository aims to document my progress and aventures in the world of embedded systems. As it just so happens, I have decided to learn the inner workings of the arduino UNO!

Prerequisite knowledge:
> A fundamental understanding of how base 2 works;
> A fundamental understanding of base 16;
> A decent grasp of the c programming langage, although I suppose one could follow along with minimal exposure;
> Knowledge of bitwise operations and logic gates
