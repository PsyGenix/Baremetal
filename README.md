# Baremetal
Introduction to Arduino coding in C 

Hello, welcome in! This repository aims to document my progress and aventures in the world of embedded systems. As it just so happens, I have decided to learn the inner workings of the arduino UNO!

Prerequisite knowledge:
> A fundamental understanding of how base 2 works;
> A fundamental understanding of base 16;
> A decent grasp of the c programming langage, although I suppose one could follow along with minimal exposure;
> Knowledge of bitwise operations and logic gates

Okie dokie! we're off to the races then; my initial exposure to the topic at hand began at this article: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/milanistef/introduction-to-bare-metal-programming-in-arduino-uno-f3e2b4 
I highly reccomend reading it as it does provide a lot of valuable information.However, it left me with more questions than answers!
